# animateMoneyCounter

**** The design for this example is from the Bank of America website. I take no credit in it's design. At the time of this commit, the website is at https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/keep-the-change/ 

### Application that takes an amount of money and increases it in an animation.
1. Clone repo
2. The given example does include a calculation for the year but you would have to adjust your element name in order for it to appear.
3. Function call: 
>  animateNumber(compareSavings, 30, "+", "total")
>
 compareSavings is the amount to add to the total. Second param is how fast the animation is. Third param is the operation. It can either be addition or subtraction. The fourth param is the element id-without hashtag.
